[Sneaky Productions](https://sneaky.productions) is a company that started two years ago with a popular digital art project (NFTs) that sold out in six seconds and remains an all-time top 20 collection. Theyâ€™ve expanded into physical products like plush toys and trading cards.

They represent an incredible vibrant community in need of a place for fans to discover more art and lore.

Making Sneakypedia is a 10 episode unfolding mini-series.

### Episode 01

We have it all: design mock-ups... structured data... web-ready images!

Challenge was: how to turn it all into an incredible over-stuffed lore rich and interactive storykeep website.

We're going to have to approach this like scientists.

### Episode 02

I arrived at Sneaky Island to assess the situation directly.

Really, there's no other way. When building web communities nothing is more important than capturing the _information schema_. It's **"the thing"** guiding all design decisions.

Once we understand the "shape" of everything we can begin to build out a web presence for this community.
