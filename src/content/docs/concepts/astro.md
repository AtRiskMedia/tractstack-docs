## Build it with Astro

Astro is an innovative web framework used by global brands to build incredible content-driven websites.

"This includes marketing sites, publishing sites, documentation sites, blogs, portfolios, landing pages, community sites, and e-commerce sites. If you have content to show, it needs to reach your reader quickly." [-Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven)

There are many [benefits](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven) of building with Astro. Tract Stack is made from scratch to take care of all this for you auto-magically. You gain the benefits but don't require a costly agency to implement them! With Tract Stack, it's all "pressed" in.

### Content-driven

A content-driven site prioritizes the user experience. It's the journey that matters most. How do you bring each visitor to conversion? This could be unlocking greater understanding through an amazing and well-written docs site. Or making that first sale! What matters is getting your content in front of your audience.

Websites built with traditional frameworks like WordPress often struggle to keep up with best practices and aren't able to deliver a great user experience.

You can mitigate this by using a modern web framework (like React). But this introduces a whole host of additional considerations and complexities. Web performance vitals and user experience may still suffer.

With the Astro core team commitment to content-driven sites, you can reset assured when you build with Astro it'll [**sensibly scale up to performant, powerful, dynamic web applications**](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#content-driven)

### Server-first

Astro is an opinionated web framework.

Many modern javascript frameworks (like Next.js, Remix) nestle in on each client browser. If you visit a website made with such a framework it will download to your browser and run there. This is great for complex web apps. But for a content-driven website? Your users want a snappy, smooth experience!

Older web frameworks (like WordPress) depend on the web server to generate each web page on request. If you visit one of these websites, the server does it work so your browser can download the html + css _pre-rendered_. While this can be very fast (esp. with caching), it's stale and lacks that dynamic snappy feel. It's old sauce.

With Astro you get the best of both worlds! [Read more](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#server-first)

### Fast by default

It's science! When you optimize the inputs, you get the best output. That Astro core team's commitment to making the web great for content is producing fruit. [Read more](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#fast-by-default)
