description: the SEO-friendly builder for content-driven websites
---

A website "pressed" with Tract Stack has some special attributes compared to other websites.

Tract Stack **is itself** an Astro starter kit. You have all the benefits of [Astro](/concepts/content-driven-website/) from the get go.

## No-code website builder

Tract Stack comes with a `Story Keep` web application. You'll log-in to your Story Keep to manage your Tract Stack. This is where you edit and create new web pages.

:::note
This is the prototype Story Keep written in Gatsby. It is being ported to Astro with a more fluid UX! Stay tuned.
Visit [Tract Stack](https://tractstack.com?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=www&utm_campaign=starlight) and click on `Try Now` (in the hero) to see in action. _Note: As we port to Astro more docs will be added!_

## SEO-friendly through and through

All the best practices get "pressed" in when you use Tract Stack: technical SEO, semantic HTML, and accessibility (A11y) done right; next gen image formats; ready for social shares; privacy-first analytics. It's all there out-of-the-box.

If you are using [Google Analytics](/integrations/google-analytics/), simply add your gtag and you're set!

## Event-driven analytics

As readers interact with your content, Tract Stack is noticing what holds everyone's attention. Each section of every page is a touch point for engagement and learning more about your audience.

Out-of-box [events](/basics/content-engagements) include `glossed`, `read`, `clicked`, `entered`

Enable [Neo4j/AuraDB](/integrations/neo4j/) and a knowledge graph will be generated to capture all the content interactions across through funnel.

## Conversion rate optimization made simple

Conversion will mean something different for each business or organization. It could be making a sale. Receiving a donation. Get some product waitlist sign-ups. New client books for your services. Insert your goal here. You know your audience best.

With Tract Stack you can add [adaptive content pathways](/recipes/adaptive/) to better engage each visitor. Based on how they've interacted with the site, a tailored call-to-action can appear at just the right moment.
