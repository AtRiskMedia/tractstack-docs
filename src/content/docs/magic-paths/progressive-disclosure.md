title: Progressive Disclosure
description: Creating adaptive content pathways that unfold based on visitor engagement
---

Progressive disclosure is TractStack's approach to gradually revealing content based on visitor beliefs and interactions. Instead of overwhelming visitors with everything at once, content unfolds naturally as they declare preferences and engage with your site.

## Core Philosophy

### The Medium as Dynamic Narrative

The medium that carries your narrative should be as dynamic and engaging as the story itself. One webpage serves many visitors, but with traditional websites, pages are pre-rendered and served without context to each visitor. TractStack transforms this paradigm by making webpages read like choose-your-own-adventures that automagically reveal the right content to the right person at the right time.

### Content Layering Strategy

**Layer 1: Default Content**

- Visible to all visitors immediately
- Core information everyone needs
- Entry points for belief declaration
- Foundation for further personalization

**Layer 2: Basic Personalization**

- Reveals after simple belief declarations
- First level of content adaptation
- Builds on default content foundation
- Encourages further engagement

**Layer 3: Deep Personalization**

- Requires multiple belief combinations
- Highly targeted content experiences
- Advanced visitor journey paths
- Specialized information and tools

**Layer 4: Expert Content**

- Complex belief requirements
- Niche, specialized information
- Advanced user capabilities
- Deep engagement rewards

## Implementation Patterns

### Entry-Level Disclosure

**Initial engagement points:**

- Simple yes/no questions early in content
- Toggle widgets for immediate preferences
- Clear value proposition for sharing information
- Immediate content adaptation to demonstrate value

**Example progression:**

1. **Default question**: "Are you interested in learning more about our platform?"
2. **Belief captured**: `Interest=BELIEVES_YES`
3. **Content reveals**: Detailed feature descriptions appear
4. **Next opportunity**: "What's your primary use case?" (persona selection)

### Cascading Revelation

**Sequential content unfolding:**

- Each belief declaration unlocks new content sections
- Previously hidden information becomes visible
- New belief capture opportunities emerge
- Visitor journey becomes increasingly personalized

**Example cascade:**

```
Default Content → Interest Widget → Feature Details →
Role Selection → Role-Specific Content → Experience Level →
Advanced Information → Contact Options
```

### Contextual Adaptation

**Content changes based on belief combinations:**

- Multiple beliefs create unique content experiences
- Conflicting beliefs hide inappropriate content
- Belief combinations trigger specialized pathways
- Adaptive calls-to-action based on declared preferences

## Content Strategy

### Planning Disclosure Paths

**Visitor journey mapping:**

1. **Identify entry points**: Where visitors typically arrive
2. **Map belief opportunities**: Natural places for preference declaration
3. **Design content layers**: What reveals at each belief level
4. **Plan conversion paths**: How disclosure leads to goals

**Content hierarchy planning:**

- **Essential information**: Always visible baseline content
- **Enhanced details**: First level of personalization
- **Specialized content**: Deep personalization rewards
- **Expert resources**: Advanced belief combinations

### Belief Sequence Design

**Logical progression:**

- Start with broad, simple preferences
- Progress to specific, detailed beliefs
- Build comprehensive visitor profiles gradually
- Maintain logical connection between beliefs and content

**Example sequence:**

1. **Interest level**: General engagement measurement
2. **Use case identification**: Role or purpose
3. **Experience level**: Skill or knowledge assessment
4. **Specific needs**: Detailed requirements or preferences
5. **Contact readiness**: Purchase or engagement intent
