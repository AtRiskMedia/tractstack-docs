Tract Stack is released under FSL-1.1-MIT. This is a mostly permissive non-compete license that converts to MIT two years after each release.

## Why?

The authors of the [FSL](https://fsl.software/) license describe it well: "Many SaaS companies wish to make the source code for their core products available under permissive terms without the risk of harmful free-riding."

Simply put, Tract Stack is free even for commercial use. However, you cannot re-sell Tract Stack "as a service".

_Are you an agency looking to leverage Tract Stack for your clients; an investor? or, big cloud provider wanting to get in before this moons? [Let's chat](mailto:hello@tractstack.com)._

## Is this open-source?

Technically, no. Not yet. In practical terms you are free to use Tract Stack as though it were MIT open-source. Commercial use is encouraged! Each release converts to MIT license after two years. In the meantime, the only prohibited use is re-selling "Tract Stack as a Service" without explicit consent.
