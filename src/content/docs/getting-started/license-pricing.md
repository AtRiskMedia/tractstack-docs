description: Source-Available under the O'Saasy License
---

Tract Stack is released under the **O'Saasy License**. This is a permissive source-available license based on MIT, but with a specific restriction against selling the software as a competing service.

## Why O'Saasy?

The O'Saasy license was originally popularized by 37signals (for Fizzy) to solve a specific problem: allowing developers to learn from and use code freely, without allowing cloud giants to package and resell that hard work.

Basically… it is the **MIT do-whatever-you-want license**, but with the commercial rights for SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) reserved for the copyright holder.

## What You Can Do

✅ **Use Tract Stack for commercial projects**
✅ **Modify the source code for your needs**
✅ **Build client websites and charge for your services**
✅ **Deploy on your own infrastructure**
✅ **Create internal business applications**
✅ **Distribute your modifications (under same license)**

## What You Cannot Do

❌ **Sell Tract Stack as a hosted service**
❌ **Compete directly with Tract Stack's business model**
❌ **Redistribute as a commercial SaaS product**

## Is This Open Source?

Technically, no. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition requires no restrictions on field of use. Because O'Saasy restricts "SaaS" usage, it is considered **Source Available**.

However, in practical terms, you are free to use Tract Stack as though it were MIT open-source for almost all use cases. The only prohibited use is re-selling "Tract Stack as a Service" or a managed cloud version without explicit consent.

## For Agencies & Developers

If you're an agency or developer looking to leverage Tract Stack for client work, you're completely covered. Build as many sites as you want, charge your clients, and modify the code. As long as you aren't launching a "Tract Stack Hosting" platform that competes with us, you are clear.
