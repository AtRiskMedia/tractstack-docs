description: Source-Available under FSL-1.1-MIT
---

TractStack is released under FSL-1.1-MIT. This is a mostly permissive non-compete license that converts to MIT two years after each release.

## Why FSL?

The authors of the [FSL](https://fsl.software/) license describe it well: "Many SaaS companies wish to make the source code for their core products available under permissive terms without the risk of harmful free-riding."

Simply put, TractStack is free even for commercial use. However, you cannot re-sell TractStack "as a service" without explicit consent.

## What You Can Do

✅ **Use TractStack for commercial projects**  
✅ **Modify the source code for your needs**  
✅ **Build client websites and charge for your services**  
✅ **Deploy on your own infrastructure**  
✅ **Create internal business applications**  
✅ **Distribute your modifications (under same license)**

## What You Cannot Do

❌ **Sell TractStack as a hosted service**  
❌ **Compete directly with TractStack's business model**  
❌ **Redistribute as a commercial product**

## Is This Open Source?

Technically, no. Not yet. In practical terms you are free to use TractStack as though it were MIT open-source. Commercial use is encouraged!

Each release converts to MIT license after **two years**. In the meantime, the only prohibited use is re-selling "TractStack as a Service" without explicit consent.

## For Agencies & Developers

If you're an agency or developer looking to leverage TractStack for client work, you're completely covered. Build as many sites as you want, charge your clients, modify the code - all permitted under FSL.

## For Investors & Cloud Providers

## Future MIT Conversion

Every TractStack release automatically becomes MIT licensed after 2 years:

- **TractStack v1.0** (Released 2023) → MIT in 2025
- **TractStack v2.0** (Released 2024) → MIT in 2026
- Future releases follow the same pattern
