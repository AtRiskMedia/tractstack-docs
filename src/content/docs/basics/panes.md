title: Panes
description: Where authenticity gains traction

A pane is one section of web page in your Tract Stack. One story fragment contains one or more panes.

Each pane has a `slug` (no spaces, letters-only). This is important because of the analytics out-of-the-box experience. When building your Tract Stack be sure to give each story fragment and pane a descriptive and meaningful `slug`.

:::note
As we port the Story Keep to astro, we will also add additional pane types! Bear with us as we build out this ecosystem

## Pane types

This will be properly documented in the new release.

### Markdown pane

While text is stored as markdown, you're presented with a WYSIWYG visual editor. Add elements (paragraph, heading, belief widget, image, etc.) and then apply tailwind utility classes.

Choose from a handful of design templates.

### Modal pane

Some fancy title box shapes and you can put text inside it!

### Background pane

Choose from a variety of transition shapes to apply a touch of colour and pizzazz to your site.
