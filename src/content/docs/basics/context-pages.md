description: For all the fine print!

Unlike traditional linear storytelling, your websiteâ€™s corpus is more like a dynamic collection of interconnected moments, each fragment holding the potential to spark interest and lead to deeper exploration.

A *context page* is a special kind of web page in your Tract Stack. Whenever you need to provide some additional context and background information, use a context page. You can link to it from anywhere. And visitors keen on that added detail have it one-click away. While others taking a more cursory glance won't get bogged down in the details.

Each has a slug and its uri is /context/slug.
