You are reading the technical guide for self-install.
If you want all this handled for you please visit [Tract Stack](https://tractstack.com/#pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=www&utm_campaign=starlight) for managed hosting options.

## Server set-up

On your server, you'll have two or more users.

The `t8k` user holds the installer and admin scripts.

Each Tract Stack _instance_ (website) will have a dedicated user account and `/home/user` folder.

### The t8k user

Tract Stack reserves the `t8k` user. You'll use this account when installing (or uninstalling) a new instance.

  - files/
- backup/

</FileTree>

### For each Tract Stack instance

Once installed you'll have a new `/home/user` folder. This is where all the magic happens! Everything you'll need to configure can be done via the Story Keep.

### Systemd path unit

During the install process a few _services_ get installed on your system. This is a `build trigger` that watches the `/home/user/releases/watch` folder. It allows a build to be called by the Story Keep. Optionally, you may opt to install a backup service that relies on [Backblaze](https://backblaze.com).

Note: if you uninstall via the `tractstack-uninstall.sh` script, this service gets removed.
