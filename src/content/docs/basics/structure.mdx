:::tip[Our "Tract Stack as a service" does all this for you]
Remember, this is a technical guide for self-install.
If you want Tract Stack as a service, visit [Tract Stack](https://tractstack.com/#pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=www&utm_campaign=starlight) for managed hosting options.

## Server set-up

On your server, you'll have two or more users.

The `t8k` user holds the installer and admin scripts.

Each Tract Stack _instance_ (website) will have a dedicated user account and `/home/user` folder.

### The t8k user

Tract Stack reserves the `t8k` user. You'll use this account when installing (or uninstalling) a new instance.

  - scripts/
  - files/

</FileTree>

### For each Tract Stack instance

Once installed you'll have a new `/home/user` folder. This is where all the magic happens! Everything you'll need to configure can be done via the Story Keep.

<FileTree>

- .env
- backup/
- log/
- watch/
- scripts/
- src/
  - tractstack-storykeep/
    - public/custom/images/
    - public/styles/custom.css
    - src/custom/
    - src/custom/codehooks.astro
    - src/custom/HeaderWidget.astro
    - Dockerfile
    - config.ts
    - .env
- srv/
  - public_html/
    - storykeep/images/
  - tractstack-concierge/
    - .env

</FileTree>

### Systemd path unit

During the install process a _service_ gets installed on your system. This is a `build trigger` that watches the `/home/user/releases/watch` folder. It allows a build to be called by the Story Keep.

Note: if you uninstall via the `tractstack-uninstall.sh` script, this service gets removed.
