title: Story fragments
description: Where authenticity gains traction
---

A story fragment is a web page in your Tract Stack.

Each story fragment has a `slug` which happens to be its uri: `/slug`. This is important because of the analytics out-of-the-box experience. When building your Tract Stack be sure to give each story fragment and pane a descriptive and meaningful `slug`.

Note: In your [Publish settings](/configuration/publish/) you can specify the slug of Story Fragment to use as homepage.

:::note
As we port the Story Keep to astro UI will be added for SEO related features such as custom description and social graph image. We also plan to add LLM-powered recommendations for keyword-rich titles, etc.
