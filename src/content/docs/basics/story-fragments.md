title: Story fragments
description: Where authenticity gains traction
---

Think of each webpage not as a self-contained unit, but as a story fragment &ndash; a piece of a larger narrative that visitors will encounter in their own unique sequence. Unlike traditional linear storytelling, your website's corpus is more like a dynamic collection of interconnected moments, each fragment holding the potential to spark interest and lead to deeper exploration.

A *story fragment* is a web page in your Tract Stack.

It has a `slug` which is also its uri: `/slug`. This is important because of the analytics out-of-the-box experience. When building your Tract Stack be sure to give each story fragment and pane a descriptive and meaningful `slug`.
