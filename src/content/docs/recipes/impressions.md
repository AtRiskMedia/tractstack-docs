In your `Pane Settings` you can enable an Impression.

An impression has a `Title` (used as a tool-tip), `Button Text`, `Body Text`, and an [Action LISP](/recipes/action-lisp/) command

When a visitor is on a page that has an impression, a notification will appear in the menu header. Upon click, the impression modal (fixed in the bottom right of the screen) will appear.
